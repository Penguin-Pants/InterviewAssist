"""Post-interview report generation (T11.4/T11.7 — FR77, FR80, FR81, FR81a).

**This module generates prose, and it is the only one in the application that does.**
The overlay's guarantee is that it cannot: a forced `tool_choice` over an id enum, and
byte-exact substring assertions on every bullet. That guarantee is untouched by this
file and must stay that way — see `report.separation` for the check that keeps it
structural rather than conventional (FR79).

The full transcript leaves the device in one call. That is the largest egress event the
product will ever make, it includes the interviewer's words, and FR81/FR81a exist so it
is never silent: confirmed every run, with the size, and with the egress indicator lit
for the whole call.

it only fixes the response shape. Report text is generated, and evidence binding — not
