"""Encrypted session storage, listing, deletion and retention (T11.2/T11.3 — FR82–FR84).

This is where D-U8's cost is paid. The product's strongest claim used to be that nothing
said or heard reached the disk; a persisted transcript trades that away, and what has to
come back in return is encryption at rest, a list the user can see, deletion they can
actually perform, and a retention default that runs without being asked.

**A third party's words are in these files.** The interviewer did not install this
software. That is the reason the key is bound to the current OS user rather than being
"good enough" ambient protection — a copied file must be inert.

Ciphers are injected through a Protocol, exactly as `CredentialBackend` is. On Windows
the default binds to DPAPI. **Elsewhere there is no default**: this module raises rather
than falling back to something weaker, because a silent downgrade to unencrypted or
obfuscated storage is precisely the kind of false guarantee this codebase keeps having
to dig out of its own tests.
