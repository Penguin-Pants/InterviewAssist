"""Pre-session readiness check (T6.5, FR38 — design §6's classification table).

Runs **automatically** at session start, not when the user remembers to. The whole
product is for someone whose stated difficulty is executive function; a readiness step
that depends on remembering to perform it is designed against its own user.

Three outcomes, not two. The classification is the requirement — T6.5's criterion is
"produces the correct block-vs-warn classification", which is untestable unless the
classification exists somewhere other than in the implementer's head.

Probes are injected. The real ones touch WASAPI, the registry and the network and only
run on Windows; the classification logic they feed is platform-free and tested here.
