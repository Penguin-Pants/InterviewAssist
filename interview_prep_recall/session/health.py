"""Health model (design §7, FR35).

Health is **orthogonal to session state**, not part of it. A session in `RUNNING`
carries a health record; there is no `RUNNING_DEGRADED`. That is what keeps the state
count at seven instead of seven times a power of two.

The single most important property here, and the reason FR35 exists at all: **"nothing
in your notes matched" must be distinguishable from "the pipeline is broken."** Both
render an empty overlay. If they look the same, the user cannot tell working from
broken at the exact moment they most need to — so `nominal` is a first-class query and
`no match` is deliberately *not* an indicator.
