"""Headless composition root (T9.0).

Every component so far has been built to be constructed by somebody else — Protocols for
the cipher, the embedder, the STT connector, the model client, injected rings and
monitors everywhere. This is the somebody else. No Qt: the UI layer builds on top of an
`Application`, it does not *contain* one, which is what makes the wiring testable on a
machine that cannot run the UI at all.

**The wiring is the point, not the plumbing.** Three guarantees in this codebase are
properties of how the pieces are connected rather than of any piece:

* **One switch, every cloud consumer** (D-23). `llm_matching` off must reach matching
  *and* report generation. It reached the pipeline only, because the pipeline was the
  only consumer when the switch was written. A second consumer arrived in M11 and
  nothing connected it — the indicator would have said local-only while report
  generation still called the API.
* **Finalised utterances reach the record** (FR74). The record existed with no producer.
* **Coverage has one adjudicator** (FR78a). The tracker decides; the report is *told*.

Each of those was recorded as a follow-up "needs the composition root". This is it.
