"""The startup sequence (T9.6 — FR63, FR38, design §4).

**This task did not exist.** T9.1a, T9.2b and T9.4 all record the same blocker in
different words — "no production caller", "no main window", "needs an entry point" — and
no task owned building one. That is the third time in this plan that a named prerequisite
had no ID (after T9.0's composition root and T9.2a's config store), so it is recorded as
**T9.6** rather than absorbed into whichever task tripped over it first.

Qt-free, like `app.py` and for the same reason: the *order* of startup is the part that
carries guarantees, and it should be checkable on a machine that cannot open a window.
`__main__.py` supplies the real presenter and notifier.

**The order is the requirement.** Three things must happen before anything else, and each
of them is a rule this codebase already learned the hard way:

1. **Consent first, and nothing is constructed until it passes.** FR63 says the
   disclosure is unavoidable. A gate that runs after the composition root has created
   directories and loaded the user's notes is a gate that ran too late — and "declined"
   would then leave state behind from a session the user refused.
2. **A config reset is reported.** Design §4 requires the user be told when their
   settings are replaced. `ConfigLoadStatus.settings_were_lost` existed with **no
   production consumer** until this module — the fifth-and-sixth instance of D-20 in this
   codebase, and one I introduced myself while writing that the notification was
   load-bearing.
3. **Preflight runs automatically** (FR38), not when the user remembers. On a machine
   with no audio devices it blocks, which is the correct answer and the honest one: the
   session cannot start, and `Preflight` already models exactly that.
