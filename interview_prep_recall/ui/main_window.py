"""The application window (T9.6 — FR38, FR52, FR37).

**Not in design §1's module layout**, and that is a deliberate deviation rather than an
oversight. §1 lists `overlay.py`, `editor.py`, `settings.py` and `indicators.py` because
the product's session UI *is* the overlay — there was never meant to be a general window.
But the overlay is M5 and blocked on `SetWindowDisplayAffinity`, and meanwhile three
tasks (T9.1a, T9.2b, T9.4) are all blocked on there being *somewhere* for the app to open
its dialogs from. This is that somewhere. When M5 lands, the overlay becomes the session
surface and this stays what it is now: the readiness-and-settings shell around it.

**M5 landed, and this is now where the overlay's chrome controls live (T5.4).** FR55 asks
for a reset control "for recovery when persisted coordinates land off-screen", so the
control cannot live on the panel it is rescuing — a button on an invisible window is not
a recovery route. FR27's lock is here for the same reason: it is the pair to the reset,
and a user who has locked the panel somewhere unreachable needs both from one place they
can always get to. Found by review on PR #21, where both existed only as methods with no
production caller.

**What it deliberately does not do.** It cannot start a session, because capture is M1
and the overlay is M5. Rather than fake a Start button that fails, it shows FR38's
preflight result — which on a machine without audio devices correctly reports blocking
failures, because `Preflight` treats a check with no probe as unsatisfied rather than
passed. The honest screen for "you cannot start yet" is the list of reasons.

        modeless dialog from being collected the moment `open_diagnostics` returns — the
        same defect the overlay's transition animation had. The Qt parent decides who
        destroys it, and without one the dialog is a parentless top-level widget torn
        down through a Python refcount, which segfaults the interpreter once enough of
        them have come and gone. Found by review on PR #21, in the same pass that gave
        the overlay a parent for the same reason.

        going wrong, and a modal dialog would block the window it is diagnosing.
