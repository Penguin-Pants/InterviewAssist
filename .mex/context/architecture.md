# Architecture

<!-- Read broad, ground tight. Architecture usually grounds sparsely. When a
     specific symbol is worth navigating to, use this inline form:
```markdown
[`someFunction()`](mex://function:<tier-1-id>)
```

## System Overview

User speaks → audio capture via WASAPI loopback → transcribed by STT (local Whisper or cloud) → transcript streamed to overlay UI → user edits/annotates in editor → session tracker records progress → reports generated from session data → notes/findings persisted to local store.

## Key Components

- **MainWindow** — PySide6 top-level window holding overlay, editor, checklist, and report views. Composition root for UI state and settings.
- **SessionManager** — tracks session state (active/paused), coordinates with audio capture, STT transcription, and report generation.
- **AudioCapture** — WASAPI loopback for system audio, VAD (voice activity detection), frames buffered for transcription.
- **STT Interface** — protocol for local (Whisper) and cloud transcription; abstraction so backends are swappable.
- **ContextSet** — in-memory session context holding notes, decisions, and findings; serialized to notes store.
- **ReportGenerator** — builds findings from session context, formats for display in report view.
- **NotesStore** — persistent JSON-based storage, handles backups and session restoration.

## External Dependencies

- **PySide6** — GUI framework; all UI components are Qt-based. Cannot be unit-tested on Linux without QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen.
- **faster-whisper** — local speech-to-text, runs on Windows with GPU acceleration optional. Cloud fallback available for resilience.
- **pyaudiowpatch** — Windows-only, WASAPI loopback for capturing system audio during interviews.
- **Anthropic SDK** — cloud transcription and LLM analysis; used when local Whisper unavailable or for confidence scoring.
- **NumPy** — core dependency, used throughout for audio frame manipulation and DSP operations.

## What Does NOT Exist Here

- No database server — all persistence is file-based (JSON). Session state lives in `AppData\Local\interview-prep-recall\`.
- No background processes or workers — everything runs in the foreground process on the interview session thread.
- No network infrastructure — cloud services are called directly by the app; no message queues or async event bus.
- No admin UI or dashboard — this is a single-user tool built for the interview candidate, not SaaS.
