# Traceability Matrix

Every v1 requirement resolves to a design section, a task, and a test. A row with a gap in any
column is a requirement nobody will build or verify.

**Legend:** D§ = [technical design](./02-technical-design.md) section · T = [task](./03-tasks.md) ·
TS§ = [test strategy](./04-test-strategy.md) section

**Known gap:** FR66–FR87 (M10/M11, added 2026-08-10 — after this matrix was first written) have
no rows below yet, even though both milestones are complete per `06-progress.md`. Their design,
task and test references live only in `07-context-sources-and-report.md` for now. Treat the "no
gaps" claim above as scoped to FR1–FR65 until those rows are backfilled.

## Deferred — specified, not built in v1

| Req | Reason | Revisit |
|---|---|---|
| FR1b (`.docx`) | D-U1 | Post-v1 |
| OQ-4 (local matching model) | Depends on OQ-1's answer | After T4.7 |
| Acoustic echo cancellation | D-8 warns instead | After OQ-3 |
| Diarization | AS-5 accepts the limitation | Post-v1 |

## Gates

| Gate | Task | Falsifies | If it fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dual-stream 60-min stability | T1.2 | AS-2 | Capture library decision reopens before anything is built on it |
| Local STT p95 < 900 ms inference tail, **CPU-only on the D-U6 laptop** | T2.4 | AS-1 | Local cannot be the default; M8 promoted ahead of M5; FR18 inverts |
| Stage-2 beats stage-1 | T4.7 | OQ-1 | The hard internet dependency is reconsidered before it is baked into the UX |
