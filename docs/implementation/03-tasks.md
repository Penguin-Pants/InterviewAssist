# Task Breakdown

Milestone order differs from the PRD's §11 in two deliberate ways, both from the safety review:
the **STT interface is specified before any backend exists** (D-2/A8), and **notes durability
lands before the overlay** (A1 — notes are the irreplaceable asset, and building UI on an unsafe
store means every later session risks the user's real prep).

Every task states acceptance criteria that are observable. A task is not done because the code
exists; it is done when its criteria are demonstrated.

**Universal definition of done** — applies to every task below, in addition to its own criteria:

1. Acceptance criteria demonstrated, by automated test where the criteria allow.
2. Unit tests for new logic; integration test if the task crosses a component boundary.
3. No new writes to disk outside the design §4 allowlist. **Enforced from M0 by a `pytest` fixture
   that fails any test touching a path outside the allowlist** — not deferred to M6. *(Reviewer A
   and B both caught that scoping this to "once the M6 harness lands" made a mandatory criterion
   unverifiable for the first six milestones, which is most of the project. T6.4's ProcMon trace
   is the full-system check; the fixture is the per-task one.)*
4. Requirement IDs referenced in the commit message.
5. Structural events emitted to the diagnostic ring (FR36) for anything that can fail — no
   silent failure paths.
6. Any decision made while implementing is added to the decision log, or the task is not done.

## M0 — Scaffold

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T0.1** Project skeleton matching design §1 module layout, `pyproject.toml`, pinned deps | — | `pip install -e .` succeeds on a clean Windows 11 venv; the package imports; module tree matches design §1 exactly. |
| **T0.2** CI: lint, type-check, unit tests on Windows runner | — | CI runs on push and fails on lint, `mypy --strict` errors on `stt/interface.py`, or test failure. |
| **T0.3** Diagnostic ring buffer (`diagnostics/ring.py`) | FR36 | Bounded to **2000 events**, evicts oldest; a test asserting no method accepts transcript or note text; export produces JSON with structural fields only. |
| **T0.4** Write-allowlist pytest fixture | FR16 | Any test writing outside design §4's allowlist fails. Active for every task from M0 onward. |
| **T0.5** Credential wrapper (`platform/credentials.py`) | FR19 | Store/retrieve under service `InterviewPrepRecall`; grep test proves absence from disk. **Moved from M8** — M4's stage-2 selector needs an Anthropic key, so credentials cannot first appear in M8. |

Built first because every subsequent task's DoD items 3 and 5 depend on T0.3/T0.4 existing.

**CI audio strategy** *(review-B "missing #16")*: hosted Windows runners have no audio endpoint. So
CI never opens a device. Every test below the manual tier feeds WAV fixtures **directly into
`SttBackend.feed()`** in the §1a format, which is exactly the format the capture callback produces —
so the pipeline under test is the real one from `feed()` onward. Device-dependent tests (T1.1, T1.2,
T1.4, T5.2, T7.2) are marked `@pytest.mark.device` and run on the developer machine, reported per
milestone. The 60-minute soak runs nightly on that machine, not in CI.

## M1 — Audio Capture Spike ⚠️ **AS-2 gate**

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T1.1** WASAPI loopback capture | FR5 | Console prints live RMS while any app plays audio; verified against 3 different video apps. 🟡 **One app passed** 2026-08-16 — 752 frames in 15 s, peak RMS 7719, no callback error. Two more apps owed. |
| **T1.2** Concurrent mic capture | FR6, D-U2 | Both streams deliver frames simultaneously for **60 minutes** with no device conflict, no dropout, and no clock drift beyond 50 ms. 🟡 **60 s passed** 2026-08-16 — both at 100% of expected, worst drift 40 ms, 0 dropped. The 60-minute run is T1.6. |
| **T1.3** Bounded queue + non-blocking callback | FR45, FR33 | Callback p99 < 2 ms under load; forced overflow drops oldest and increments a counter rather than growing memory. ✅ **Done** |
| **T1.4** Device enumeration + default-change notification | FR39 | Switching the default output device and unplugging headphones each fire a callback within 1 s. 🟡 **Enumeration passed** 2026-08-16 — 6 loopback endpoints and a default mic resolved. The change-notification half needs a person to switch a device. |
| **T1.5** Keep-alive tests | D-68 | Unit tests over `CaptureStream`'s keep-alive, against a fake `pa`: a loopback device opens one and reports `keep_alive_active`; a microphone does not; teardown closes the **capture** stream before the keep-alive; a failed open is recorded in `keep_alive_error` rather than raised, with capture still running. *(`render_device_for` has 5 tests already; this is the half that has none.)* |
| **T1.6** The AS-2 gate, with pauses | FR5, FR6, D-U2, D-68 | **First**, the discriminating check: `dual --seconds 20` with playback **paused** delivers ~100% on both streams. That exact command returned `interviewer=0` before D-68. **Then** the 60-minute run, with natural pauses rather than continuous playback, mic unclaimed. Redirect to a file — the `\r` progress line makes 3600 ticks unreadable in a captured pipe. |

**Gate:** if T1.2 fails, `pyaudiowpatch` is not viable for D-U2's dual-stream requirement and the
capture library decision reopens **before** anything is built on top. Stop and escalate.

**The gate did not fire, and M1 earned its place anyway.** The library and concurrency question is
answered (AS-2, half measured). What the spike actually bought was **D-68**: an idle WASAPI loopback
endpoint delivers *no callbacks at all* rather than frames of silence, which breaks utterance
finalisation downstream. Nothing in the vendor documentation the capture code was written from said
so, and no test on a machine without a sound card could have found it.

## M2 — STT Interface & Local Backend ⚠️ **AS-1 gate**

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T2.1** Write `stt/interface.py` — Protocol, event types, and the §2 semantic contract as docstrings | FR17, D-2 | Passes `mypy --strict`. A conformance test suite exists that any backend can be run against, written before any backend. |
| **T2.2** `local_whisper.py` with VAD-based synthesized finalization | FR18, FR47 | Passes the T2.1 conformance suite. Every acknowledged span yields exactly one final event. | ✅ **Done** (AS-9: the model adapter itself is unverified — `huggingface.co` is blocked here).
| **T2.3** Utterance assembler | FR46 | Scripted fixture produces exactly the expected utterance boundaries; sub-threshold fragments merge forward; no match fires on interim events. |
| **T2.4** Latency harness | NFR1, AS-1, NFR7 | Timestamped scripted audio → transcript; reports p50/p95 **per stage** against design §9a's budget. Run **CPU-only on the D-U6 laptop** for the gate; the D-U6 desktop's CUDA figure is recorded separately (NFR7) and never substituted. Covers the STT slice only — end-to-end NFR1 is T5.9, after the overlay exists. |

**Gate:** T2.4 p95 ≥ **900 ms of inference tail** (design §9a's STT slice — *not* 3 s end-to-end, which is the whole NFR1 budget) means AS-1 is false. Local is not the viable default, and M8 (cloud) is
promoted ahead of M5. Record the measurement in the decision log either way — this is the PRD's
own §12 open risk and it gets answered here, not assumed.

---

## M3 — Notes Store & Indexing

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T3.1** `Note`/`NoteSet` model + schema v1 | FR41, FR42, FR43 | Round-trips through JSON with byte equality; IDs are UUID4 and stable across mutations. |
| **T3.2** Atomic write + backup rotation | FR28, FR29 | **`taskkill /F` during save, 10 consecutive runs, notes intact every time.** Rotation preserves 5 generations. |
| **T3.3** Schema version guard + corruption recovery | FR31, FR44 | `schema_version` N+1 refuses cleanly and leaves the file untouched; a truncated file offers restore. |
| **T3.4** Export / import bundle | FR30 | Export → wipe → import yields deep equality on content, tags, bullets, order. |
| **T3.5** Importer: chunking + bullet proposal | FR1a, FR2, FR42 | `.md` splits on `##`/`###`, `.txt` on blank lines / `Q:`-`A:`; save is blocked until review is confirmed; every proposed bullet is a verbatim substring of the source. ✅ **Done** — the chunkers landed in M3; **T3.7a below is the surface that calls them**. |
| **T3.6** Embedding index + model-version guard | FR34 | Changing the `embed_model_id` **attribute inside** the `.npz` forces a full re-embed; changing one note's headline re-embeds only that note. *(Test the attribute, not the filename — renaming the file produces a cache miss, which is a different code path from the mismatch FR34 describes.)* A corrupt `.npz` is deleted and rebuilt. |
| **T3.7** Notes editor UI (CRUD, reorder, tags, `track_progress`) | FR3, FR4, FR60 | All operations persist; IDs stable; "not overlay-optimised" flag shows for bullet-less notes (D-6); delete requires confirmation. **Saves on explicit action or 5 s idle after an edit — never per keystroke**, so FR29's 5 backup generations cannot be consumed by typing. ✅ **Done** — `ui/editor.py`. Kind is offered at creation and disabled after (FR67); FR42's verbatim check runs **before** the write, so the store never holds bullets the render boundary would refuse. |
| **T3.8** Note-set lifecycle UI | FR43, FR60 | Create, rename, select-active, delete a note set; active set persists in `QSettings`; delete confirms. *(Was missing — FR43 and FR60 referenced note sets that no task built.)* ✅ **Done** — switching goes through `Application.activate_context_set`, which **rebuilds the index and re-points the prefilter**: assigning `context_set` alone left matching on the previous corpus. Refused mid-session. The last set cannot be deleted, and the switch happens before the file is removed. |
| **T3.7a** Import UI (paste, `.txt`, `.md`) | FR1a, FR2, FR60, FR66 | The three source paths; the strategy is **named and switchable** before saving; every chunk is presented and editable; import is blocked until chunks are reviewed; importing replaces one kind and leaves the other four byte-identical (FR66), confirmed with the count it will replace (FR60). *(T3.5's importer and T10.3's `add_source` both had passing tests and no caller.)* ✅ **Done** — `ui/import_notes.py`, reached from the editor's **Import…** button. |
| **T3.9** Backup restore UI | FR29, FR44 | Browse the 5 generations, preview, restore. If a backup is itself corrupt, fall through to the next generation and say so. *(FR29 required "restorable from the UI" and no task built it.)* ✅ **Done** — `ui/restore.py`, reached from the editor's **Restore…** button and offered automatically when a set fails to open (FR44). Preview goes through `read_backup`, which never writes; restoring the **active** set re-points the index, prefilter and tracker through `activate_context_set`, and asks `can_change_context_set` *before* the write. `load_active_set` now recovers a corrupt set instead of starting empty. |

---

## M4 — Matching Pipeline ⚠️ **OQ-1 gate**

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T4.1** Stage-1 prefilter | FR9, FR50 | Returns top-K ≥ τ_floor; returns empty for unrelated speech; latency < 50 ms for 200 notes. |
| **T4.2** Stage-2 selector, forced tool call | FR10, FR48 | Every request has forced `tool_choice` and an enum of **≤6** members with 200 notes loaded; a mocked freeform response is rejected by the client. |
| **T4.3** Sequence gate | FR32 | Injected out-of-order completion never renders a stale result. Explicit test: dispatch A(1), dispatch B(2), complete A first — assert A is discarded, not rendered. |
| **T4.4** Degraded fallback | FR49, D-U3 | Stage-2 forced to fail: above τ_degraded emits `DEGRADED`, below emits no-match. |
| **T4.5** Debounce, retry, ceiling | FR40 | ≤1 in flight; ≤1 retry on 429/5xx; ceiling triggers local-only + FR35 signal. |
| **T4.6** Matching consumes interviewer stream only | FR53 | Mic utterances never enter the matching queue. |
| **T4.7** **Measurement: stage-1-only vs stage-1+2 accuracy** | OQ-1, AS-3, AS-7, NFR6 | On ≥3 recorded mock-interview transcripts with real notes: report precision/recall for both configurations, stage-2 call count, token spend, and p95 added latency. |

**Gate:** T4.7 decides OQ-1. If stage 2 adds little over stage 1, the hard internet dependency
(§12's own first open question) is reconsidered before it is baked into the UX.

---

## M5 — Overlay UI

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T5.1** Frameless, translucent, always-on-top teleprompter panel | FR11 | Renders headline + ≤3 verbatim bullets; every rendered string is a byte-exact substring of the stored note.  ✅ **Done** — the substring rule is enforced in `SnippetView.__post_init__`, not just asserted in a test. |
| **T5.2** Capture exclusion + failure warning | FR14, FR14a | Overlay absent across 6 combinations (Zoom/Teams/Meet × full-screen/window). Forced API failure produces the persistent warning. |
| **T5.3** Confirmed vs degraded visual states | FR51 | Distinguishable at 1 m without reading text.  ✅ **Done** — rails plus a `~` glyph, because the rails differ in hue rather than luminance. |
| **T5.4a** Brightness/opacity model + reset | FR24, FR27, **FR65** | ✅ **Done** — the contrast sweep runs over all 101 settings and verifies WCAG ratios computed in-module, rather than restating design §9b's table. |
| **T5.4** Drag, resize, lock (the direct-manipulation half) | FR22–23, FR27, FR55 | Each independent; off-screen persisted coordinates recoverable via reset.  ✅ **Done** — drag/resize/lock split from their Qt events so the clamping is testable without synthesising OS input; FR22's top-centre default; FR23's text scaling, with the bullet line allowance measured from the panel rather than capped at two (D-51). FR27's toggle and FR55's reset are **controls on `MainWindow`**, not methods on the panel — the case FR55 exists for is a panel the user cannot reach. The brightness sweep this row also listed was already delivered and tested by T5.4a. |
| **T5.5** Transitions + auto-clear + pin | FR25, FR54, FR13 | Unpinned clears at τ_visible; pinned persists; replacement animates.  ✅ **Done** — pull-based `tick(now)`, so FR54 is tested against a fake clock. |
| **T5.6** `QSettings` persistence | FR26 | Survives restart; documented as exempt from §4.  ✅ **Done** |
| **T5.10** **The match feed** — pipeline result → overlay | FR11, FR35, FR49, FR51, FR72, D-5, D-6 | The wire no task owned: the overlay tasks built the panel, the matching tasks built the pipeline, and nothing joined them. `Application.on_result` defaulted to a no-op lambda and **nothing assigned it**, so `show_snippet` and `from_stored_note` had no production callers and the product's central behaviour never happened. Includes **D-6's truncation**, which was specified and never implemented, and `start_clock` for FR54 — also uncalled. ✅ **Done** — `ui/match_feed.py`, wired in `ui/main_window.py`. |
| **T5.7** Health + egress indicators | FR7, FR14a, FR20, FR35 | Every state in design §7 renders distinctly; **no-match is visually distinct from every failure state**. Egress renders **cloud STT and LLM distinguishably** (§9b), not one shared dot. Includes the FR7 capture indicator, which FR20 is defined relative to. Built to §9b's token table.  ✅ **Done** — distinctness is asserted pairwise over every §7 state, because it is a property of the set and no per-state assertion can express it. Renders FR14a's warning bar; T5.2 still owns producing the failure it renders. |
| **T5.8** Diagnostics viewer | FR36 | In-app view of the ring buffer with export. *(FR36 required "viewable in-app"; T0.3 built only the buffer.)*  ✅ **Done** — `ui/diagnostics_view.py`, reached from the main window. Export is user-initiated only; opening the view writes nothing. |
| **T5.9** End-to-end latency harness | NFR1, NFR3 | Measures **last audio sample → overlay paint** against §9a's per-stage budget, p50/p95, CPU-only on the D-U6 laptop. Also measures video-call frame time with the overlay active vs inactive (NFR3). *(T2.4 covers the STT slice only and lands before the overlay exists, so neither NFR had a task that could verify it.)* |

---

## M6 — Session Lifecycle & Privacy

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T6.1** Session state machine | D-7 | All transitions in design §6 exercised; illegal transitions raise. |
| **T6.2** Purge | FR15 | **Audio** buffers are `bytearray` and post-purge bytes are zero. **Transcript text is `str`** — verify via the object-identity sweep in FR15 (`gc.get_referrers` over recorded `id()`s, plus weakrefs on the `TranscriptEvent`/`Utterance` containers, which unlike `str` support them). Do **not** assert transcript memory is zeroed; unsatisfiable, and it would pass vacuously. |
| **T6.3** Purge scope + in-flight neutralisation, **on session end** | FR58, FR59 | Note files byte-identical before/after. **Socket cancelled** (asyncio); **LLM response discarded via nonce** after its 5 s timeout — not cancelled, because it cannot be. No post-purge render. |
| **T6.3b** Panic **surface** in the UI | FR60, FR64a, **FR87** | The control itself, which no task had ever named — T6.3a built the state machine's half and nothing could press it. Single action, no confirmation (FR60); pausing is *visible* rather than inferred; Resume beside it; and FR87's signpost. ✅ **Done** — `ui/main_window.py`, headless-tested. Pressing it before a session says so instead of raising. |
| **T6.3a** Panic control pauses only | FR64a | State is `PAUSED` with cause `PANIC`; **no purge hook fires**; panic from an existing pause promotes the cause rather than raising, so a machine pause cannot auto-resume afterwards; resume returns to `RUNNING`. *(Supersedes the `WIPED` half of the old T6.3 — D-U11.)* |
| **T6.4** WER dump suppression + FR16 allowlist harness | FR16 | Process Monitor trace over a 45-min simulated session shows no writes outside the allowlist and no session content in any written file. |
| **T6.5** Preflight readiness check | FR38 | Each precondition failed in turn produces the correct block-vs-warn classification. |
| **T6.6** Backpressure + worker restart + sleep/lock | FR33, FR61, FR62 | Saturation drops oldest with flat memory; worker restarts once then holds; lock/unlock resumes. |
| **T6.7** Degradation switches | FR37 | Each toggles mid-session without restart. |

---

## M7 — Progress Tracker

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T7.1** Mic-only tracking against `track_progress` notes | FR12, FR56 | Speaking a tracked point marks it within 5 s; the same phrase played through loopback only does **not** mark it. |
| **T7.2** Echo detection in preflight | FR57 | Over speakers: warning fires. Over headphones: no warning. Measured cross-correlation logged to the ring buffer. |
| **T7.3** Runtime echo suppression | FR57, FR56, D-8 | Play a question through speakers so it reaches both streams: assert the **interviewer utterance still matches normally**, and assert the echoed **mic** utterance does **not** mark a tracked point. Both assertions required — passing only the first would mean the echo is being dropped from the wrong stream. |
| **T7.4** Checklist rendering in overlay | FR12 | Built to §9b's tracker tokens; visible without displacing the snippet; respects FR37's off switch. ✅ **Done** — `ui/checklist.py`, docked below the bullets, max 5 rows then scroll, fed from `Application.on_tracker_update` through `OverlayPanel.tracker_updated` — a signal, because `consume` runs on the STT backend's thread and the STT contract's item 7 requires consumers to enqueue. Tested headless. **Follow-up T7.4a**: the panel cannot grow past FR23's 600px maximum, so a user who has already maximised the panel gives the checklist's height up from the bullets' elision allowance. ✅ **Measured on 2026-08-16** — at 600px the allowance falls from 7 lines to 5, and **the `MIN_BULLET_LINES` floor is never reached there**: it engages at the *minimum* size, where the measurement comes out at zero. The floor was filed under the maximum and tested there, which asserted nothing. **Whether five lines reads well is still a real-surface judgement and rides with T5.9.** **T7.4b** ✅ **Fixed on 2026-08-16 (taller panel)** — at FR23's *minimum* height a five-row checklist overflowed the panel by **34px**: `rendered_height` grew by the checklist's reservation assuming the bullets keep their height, and at the minimum `MIN_BULLET_LINES` lifts them from one line to two. The panel now grows to whichever is larger, the user's height plus the reservation or the height the content actually needs — still clamped at FR23's maximum. Swept across three heights, two widths and four checklist lengths: no overflow anywhere.|

---

## M8 — Cloud STT Backends

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T8.1** Deepgram backend | FR17, FR18 | Passes the T2.1 conformance suite unmodified — the proof that D-2's interface actually abstracts. |
| **T8.2** ElevenLabs backend | FR17, FR18 | Same. |
| **T8.3** Credential storage | FR19 | Key in Credential Manager; absent from app data dir and from a diagnostic export (grep test). |
| **T8.4** Auto-fallback on drop | FR21 | Socket killed mid-session: local resumes within 5 s, notice shown. |
| **T8.5** Egress indicator wiring | FR20 | Fires for cloud STT audio and for LLM text independently and distinguishably. |

---

## M9 — Packaging & First Run

| Task | Requirements | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **T9.0** **Headless composition root** — construct and wire every component; no Qt | FR37, FR85, D-23 | One switch flip reaches **every** cloud consumer, asserted per consumer; finalised utterances reach the record; the tracker's uncovered set reaches report generation. *(Added 2026-08-11: the plan named "the composition root" as the blocker for two recorded follow-ups but never gave it a task, so nothing owned it.)* |
| **T9.1** First-run consent disclosure | FR63 | Unavoidable on first run, blocks until acknowledged, persists. ✅ **Done** — policy + Qt dialog, tested headless. **Follow-up T9.1a**: call the gate before device open (needs M1's capture path). |
| **T9.2a** **`config.json` store** | FR52, FR84, D-9, design §4 | Schema version, forward-only migrations, `.bak.1` before a migrating write, defaults-on-corrupt **with the reset reported to the caller**. *(Added 2026-08-14: T9.2 required settings to be "persisted" and design §4 specified the file in full, but no task owned building it — the T9.0 situation exactly.)* ✅ **Done** |
| **T9.2** Settings surface | FR52, FR37, D-9 | Sensitivity, thresholds, model ID, backend choice all editable and persisted. ✅ **Done** — Qt dialog + `SettingsApplier`, tested headless. **Follow-up T9.2b**: no production caller constructs the dialog (no main window until T9.3). |
| **T9.3** Setup wizard | US-B3, FR38 | Walks device selection, audio test, echo check, notes import. ⛔ **Blocked on M1** — three of its four steps are audio. Verified 2026-08-14: `pyaudiowpatch` has **no Linux distribution at all**, `/dev/snd` does not exist and there is no sound subsystem in the container. Unlike the Qt claim this is a real hardware dependency. |
| **T9.1a** Enforce FR63 at capture start | FR63 | Opening an audio device is refused when `require_first_run_consent` returns DECLINED. *(Split out 2026-08-14: T9.1's gate has no enforcement point until M1 exists — recorded rather than faked at the wrong layer.)* Also: decide whether `closeEvent` should honour `WM_QUERYENDSESSION` so an OS shutdown is not blocked by the disclosure. |
| **T9.2b** Open the settings dialog from the app | FR52, FR37 | ✅ **Done in T9.6.** |
| ~~T9.2b (original)~~ | FR52, FR37 | A main window or menu constructs `SettingsDialog`, feeds `on_switch` to `SessionManager.set_switch`, and passes the result to `Application.apply_settings`. *(Split out 2026-08-14: the pieces exist and are tested; nothing opens them, because there is no main window yet — same shape as T9.1a.)* |
| **T9.6** **Application entry point** | FR63, FR38, design §4 | `python -m interview_prep_recall` runs the startup sequence: consent gate before anything is constructed, config-reset notice, automatic preflight, window with a settings route. *(Added 2026-08-14: T9.1a, T9.2b and T9.4 all recorded "no entry point" as their blocker and no task owned building one — the third unowned prerequisite in this plan, after T9.0 and T9.2a.)* ✅ **Done** |
| **T9.6b** Run preflight at **session** start | FR38 | `SessionManager.request_start()` / `preflight_result()` are driven by a real session-start action, with `startup.run_preflight` as the source. *(Found by review on PR #18: FR38 says "at session start" and the entry point runs it at *process* start. The session-start path cannot be wired until something can start a session — M1. The staleness half is fixed: settings changes re-run the checks.)* |
| **T9.6a** Real dependency construction | FR43, D-U3 | `_build_application` constructs the embedder, model client, cipher and active note set. **Deliberately unimplemented**, on two blockers — not three. ~~FR43's active-note-set selection~~ **is done**: T3.8 writes the id and `ui.editor.load_active_set(root, default_settings())` reads it. ~~the **no-API-key policy**~~ **is also done: D-U12 (2026-09-09) decided local at startup, cloud keys optional**, so `client` becomes optional and `Stage2Selector` conditional on a key. What remains is the two dependencies themselves — the embedding model, blocked in this container by network policy rather than by platform, and DPAPI, which is genuinely Windows-only. Note the embedder is a *bigger* gap than "a model download": **no concrete `Embedder` implementation exists at all**, only the Protocol at `notes/index.py`, so matching returns no candidates even with a model present. **D-U13 (2026-09-09) settles how the models arrive** — first run downloads them, the user picks the Whisper model, the embedder is fixed and never a user choice, and the VAD ships bundled — so this task is now implementation with no open questions in front of it. It also gains a `model_present` BLOCK check in `session/preflight.py`. Raising is the honest state. |
| **T9.4** PyInstaller build | — | Single exe launches on a clean Windows 11 machine with no Python installed; FR16 allowlist re-verified against the packaged build, not just the dev build. **Note:** a failed startup shows a *modal* message box, so any non-interactive smoke test must drive or suppress it or the run hangs — verified by running the entry point headless. |
| **T9.5** Confirm live Haiku pricing and model availability | NFR6, D-9, BC-5 | Rates confirmed against current docs before ship; §7's cost estimate updated if stale. |

**Deferred beyond v1:** `.docx` import (FR1b) · local matching model (OQ-4) · acoustic echo
cancellation · diarization.

## Critical Path & Parallelism

```
M0 ──► M1 ──► M2 ──┬──► M4 ──► M5 ──► M6 ──► M7 ──► M9
                   │           ▲
       M3 ─────────┘           │
       (parallel with M1/M2)   M8 (parallel with M5/M6, after M2)
```

- **M3 can start immediately after M0** — the notes store has no dependency on audio, and it
  carries the review's highest-severity finding.
- **M8 needs only M2's interface**, so cloud backends can be built in parallel with the overlay.
- **M1 and M2 are hard gates.** Both answer PRD §12's open risks with measurements. Neither may
  be assumed to pass.
